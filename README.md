# desici
DESI Commissioning Instrument planning and analysis code.

Organization is encouraged, but this repository will not be held to the
same coding standards as other desihub repos for unittests, documentation,
installation configuration, etc.

Basic organization:
  * bin/ : executable scripts
  * py/desici : utility modules to be imported by other code
  * doc/ : documentation
  * doc/nb : example notebooks

Depending upon how this evolves, we may add a setup.py, etc/desici.module,
etc.
